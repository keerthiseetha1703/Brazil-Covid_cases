# Brazil-Covid_cases
The research papers shows the CORREALTION between temperature and Covid-19 cases in Brazil

Task at hand is to evaluate the impact of various factors - temperature, density,population, days since the first case on the growth of Covid-19 cases in Brazil.
Data is derived from the Brazil Ministry of Health and the weather.
Further data is derived for density of population using Google.

Data is read into the pandas Dataframe. Transoformations are made and correaltions are found. From the data available, other required data is acquired using different calculations.
ML models are built using different alpha parameters.My results are compared against the results in the papers and deductions are drawn.
